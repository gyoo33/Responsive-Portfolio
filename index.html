        <p>I am currently attending a coding bootcamp at Columbia University. Previously, I was working as an IT Consultant at a Big 4 accounting firm. My desire to switch careers has led me to this bootcamp.
        <br/><br/>I love dogs and often dogsit for my sister's chorkie named Lexie. My husband and I would love to adopt a dog of our own.
        <br/><br/>Last year I went skydiving for the first time in Hawaii. Although I never thought I would skydive in my lifetime, it the most thrilling experience to date.</p>
